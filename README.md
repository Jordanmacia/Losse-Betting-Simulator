This script is my first project and has been created with the help of an introductory course to Linux (Bash) from Hack4u.io academy. This script is a command-line program written in Bash that simulates a betting game using the Martingale or InverseLaBrouchere technique. It allows the user to enter the amount of money they want to play with and choose between two options of game techniques. The program performs the calculations and corresponding bets according to the selected technique until the player runs out of money or decides to exit the game. At the end of the game, it displays the total number of plays, the maximum amount of money that could have been won, and a list of consecutive bad plays that have occurred. It is important to note that the purpose of this script is purely educational and recreational, and it does not seek to encourage or promote gambling or gambling addiction behaviors. It is always important to engage in responsible gambling and be aware of the associated risks. In fact, this script demonstrates precisely that betting houses always win in the long run, so it is better not to take unnecessary risks.
